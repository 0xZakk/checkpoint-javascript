# JavaScript Checkpoint

Fork and clone this repository and complete the three sections below. Make at least one commit for each section. When you finish, push your commits to your forked repository. Wait to make your Pull Request until the end of the hour.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for **ALL** variable declarations (for testing purposes). **DO NOT** use `const` or `let`.

## Pro Tip: Test Your Code

You should first test your code's functionality in the browser console with the included `index.html` file.

Once you think your code is correct, you can run the tests that will evaluate your solutions to double-check them.

To do so, first install the testing packages...

```bash
 $ npm install
```

Then call the test runner each time you want to check your code...

```bash
 $ npm test
```

This will execute a set of automated tests to check that your code is fulfilling each prompt.

## Fundamentals
Follow the prompts and write your code in `fundamentals.js`

## Higher-Order Functions
Follow the prompts and write your code in `hof.js`

## OOJS
Follow the prompts and write your code in `oojs.js`
